### A Glimpse of My Life
Welcome to my blurb! I'm Kelly Zhang and a rising second-year in the College. I'll be telling you a bit more about myself today.

***Places of Residence*** I was born in St. Paul, MN and moved to Santa Fe, NM and later to the suburbs of Washington D.C., where I still reside today. 

***Hobbies and Interests*** I've tried a handful of sports ranging from gymnastics to figure skating to field hockey but my favorite is skating. I skated on a synchronized skating team for three years and later played varsity field hockey for two years. 

Outside of sports, I enjoy...
* amateur gardening-my pea sprouts unfortunately withered away a few days ago after weeks of loving care
* browsing space and airplane related news and memes
* experimenting with online applications to track flights
* zooming with friends
* wasting away on Netflix

***UChicago Involvement*** I'm also a member of Salisbury's House Council, The Blue Chips, Army ROTC, and Student Alumni Committee. I am also a prospective math/CAMS, statistics, or economics (surprise!) major.

***Near-Future Vision*** I enrolled in this course in part because of the requirements of UChicago's Summer Institute in Social Research Methods program and also because I had a taste of R this past quarter in a statistics class and wanted to build a stronger foundation in the language. I look forward to getting to know you all through this course and I can't wait to feel the pure happiness this seal is experiencing: <br />
