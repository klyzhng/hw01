### A Glimpse of My Life
Welcome to my blurb! I'm Kelly Zhang and a rising second-year in the College. I'll be telling you a bit more about myself today.

***Places of Residence*** I was born in St. Paul, MN and moved to Santa Fe, NM and later to the suburbs of Washington D.C., where I still reside today. 

***Hobbies and Interests*** I've tried a handful of sports ranging from gymnastics to figure skating to field hockey but my favorite is skating. I skated on a synchronized skating team for three years and later played varsity field hockey for two years. 

Outside of sports, I enjoy...
* amateur gardening-my pea sprouts unfortunately withered away a few days ago after weeks of loving care
* browsing space and airplane related news and memes
* experimenting with online applications to track flights
* zooming with friends
* wasting away on Netflix
