### A Glimpse of My Life
Welcome to my blurb! I'm Kelly Zhang and a rising second-year in the College. I'll be telling you a bit more about myself today.

***Places of Residence*** I was born in St. Paul, MN and moved to Santa Fe, NM and later to the suburbs of Washington D.C., where I still reside today.
